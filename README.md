# Python-challenge

##Background
If you're looking to expand your skill set and dive into the world of programming, Python is an excellent language to learn. In this assignment, you'll have the opportunity to put your knowledge to the test with two real-world challenges: PyBank and PyPoll. These projects require you to apply your Python scripting skills to analyze financial data and election results, respectively. By completing these tasks, you'll gain valuable experience in data analysis and manipulation, as well as proficiency in the Python language. So, put aside your Excel sheets and get ready to take on the exciting world of Python programming!

### Before you begin
To ensure that you're well-prepared for the upcoming Python challenges, there are several crucial steps that you need to take before diving into the code. First, create a new repository for this project and give it the name "python-challenge." It's important not to add this assignment to an existing repository to keep everything organized and manageable.

Next, clone this new repository to your computer to start working on it locally. Inside the repository, create two new folders named PyBank and PyPoll. These folders will house all the relevant files and resources for each Python assignment.

Within each folder, create a new file called main.py. This script will be the primary file used to run each analysis. Additionally, create a Resources folder in each directory containing the CSV files you'll be using. It's essential to ensure that your scripts have the correct path to these files for your analysis to work correctly. Finally, add an analysis folder to each directory to store the text file containing the results of your analysis.

Once you've completed these steps, push all of your changes to GitHub or GitLab to keep everything backed up and synchronized. With these preparations complete, you're now ready to tackle the Python challenges with confidence and ease!

### PyBank Instructions
Welcome to the PyBank challenge! Your objective is to develop a Python script that can analyze the financial records of your company. You'll be working with a dataset called budget_data.csv, which consists of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses."

Your task is to create a Python script that will calculate the following values based on the provided dataset:

The total number of months included in the dataset
The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, followed by the average of those changes
The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
Once you've completed the analysis, your results should align with the expected output. This project will challenge your Python skills and require you to utilize your knowledge of data manipulation, analysis, and presentation.

## Pypoll Instructions
Welcome to the PyPoll challenge! Your goal is to help a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. You'll be working with a poll dataset called election_data.csv, which consists of three columns: "Voter ID," "County," and "Candidate."

Your task is to create a Python script that can analyze the votes and calculate the following values:

The total number of votes cast
A complete list of candidates who received votes
The percentage of votes each candidate won
The total number of votes each candidate won
The winner of the election based on popular vote
This project will require you to apply your knowledge of data manipulation, analysis, and presentation to accurately and efficiently process the provided dataset. Once you've completed the analysis, your results should align with the expected output. 

## Hints and consideration
As you tackle the PyBank and PyPoll challenges, consider the various tools and concepts you've learned so far in your Python journey. You can import modules like csv to read and write files, store data in variables, lists, and dictionaries, iterate through data structures, and debug your code.

With these skills in mind, break down the tasks into smaller, discrete objectives. The datasets for these challenges are intentionally large to demonstrate the limitations of Excel-based analysis and showcase the power of Python for handling big data.

Create a separate script for each dataset and test them individually to ensure that your code works as intended. Don't forget to commit your work regularly and push it to GitHub or GitLab for backup. Finally, make sure your repository has a detailed README.md file to document your project.
